### Terraform

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **"Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that lets you define and manage your cloud resources—like servers, databases, and networks—using simple configuration files. Instead of clicking around in the cloud console, you write code, and Terraform automatically creates, updates, or deletes resources to match that code. It works with multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and keeps track of your infrastructure state so changes are predictable and repeatable."**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Or

**human-understandable** in an interview:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **"Think of Terraform like a blueprint for your cloud setup. You describe what you want—like 'I need 2 servers and a database'—and Terraform talks to the cloud and builds it for you. If you later change the blueprint, Terraform updates the real setup to match it."**

**Key points interviewers expect you to cover:**

* **IaC**: Write code to manage infrastructure.
* **Multi-cloud**: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and more.
* **Declarative**: You describe the desired state, Terraform figures out how to get there.
* **State management**: Keeps track of what’s deployed.
* **Automation**: Repeatable and version-controlled infrastructure.
